# apollo-checkm8
Apollo is a new type of jailbreak based on the checkm8 exploit. Apollo allows every single package manager and even ones that are not natively supported to run on the jailbroken device.
Apollo also provides an API for making easy tweaks and for uploading your package manager to Apollo. Apollo doesn't work on repo's. All of the app's are stored on our servers, making for a clean and malware-free experience.

# About Me

Hello, I'm 0_zeroday (the one writing this). I am a Cydia tweak and repo developer and a future security researcher. I'm 14 years old and love to program. I specialize in Use-After-Free exploits so when I saw checkm8, I new I had to make a jailbreak.
